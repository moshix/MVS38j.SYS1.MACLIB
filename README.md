# This is the open source, public domain IBM MVS 3.8j (ca 1981) macro library, preserved for posterity.


This library can be useful when porting software, or for assembler work under x86-based mainframe assemblers, such as the Dignus assembler. 

Please be advised that this macro library is different from the adapted, enhanced, fixed, and upgraded macro libaries usually included with the MVS 3.8 Turnkey systems (3 or 4). Those are usually called SYS2.MACLIB, or SYS2.AMODGEN.
